/*
	Write  at least 15 queries (ten question-type queries and five
	report-type queries) that are "interesting," substantially-different, and structurallydifferent,
	i.e., operations that require some of the more complex SQL constructs
	such as subqueries, aggregates, set operators, etc.

	Remember that, while queries are supposed to answer a particular question, the
	purpose of a report is to provide a summary of more of the content of the
	database. Sometimes the difference really comes down to quantity: while a query
	generates a single tuple or a small set of tuples, a report may generate dozens or
	more tuples. In general, a report is designed to be more human readable and to
	present information in tabular form. (See the original General Project Description
	document for some specific examples.)

	For the SQL queries demonstrated, ensure that there is at least one join, at least one
	nested query, at least one appropriate use of an aggregate function (such as min(),
	max(), avg(), sum(), etc.) within a select statement; at least one group-by, and at
	least one compound where condition (with at least a couple of sub-conditions that
	are different from join conditions). Note that these requirements ask for structurally
	different queries (these queries will be part of the 15 required queries).

	For the SQL reports demonstrated, at least two of your reports should be based on
	queries involving more than one table. You may employ concatenation to put
	together a full name or an address into a more readable form. You may also employ
	more than one query to construct a report. For instance, you may have a table with
	sales of a particular item or set of items, and then also compute the sales total.

	****************************
	Make sure that your script is well commented and it clearly describes your
	queries and the rationale for each of them. Furthermore, the results should be clearly
	labeled, well-organized and easy to read.
