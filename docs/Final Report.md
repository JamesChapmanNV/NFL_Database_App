## Introduction
The NFL Database Application manages and reports information for NFL games during the past decade (2013 - 2023). This system allows the user to easily retrieve information about players, teams, games, and even plays within each game (where available). With over 1.5 million records, users are able to obtain information down to each play made by a specific player in a game. The application itself is a lightweight, command line program that can be used once a user registers for an account. Target users are statisticians and eager NFL fans who want to have specific NFL game information at their fingertips! In addition to being able to view a data snapshot, users can export the snapshot in a filetype of their choice (ex. markdown or CSV) for their own use.
